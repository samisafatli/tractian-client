## Install and Run

* `yarn`
* `yarn start`

## Considerations

To use this API you will need Node and Mongo. You can use insomnia to easily make HTTP requests and populate the Database. If you do not populate the Database, the API will be set a mocked data just for testing purpose.

## API to be called
This is the [API](https://github.com/samisafatli/tractian) that will be used on this client.

## Future Changes
This application can and will be improved. This is a list of some improvements to be made
- Add validations to the requests
- Deploy the app on Netlify
- Styling
- Manage Assets, Companies and Units
- Create testing
